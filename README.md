# Star.jl
Star is an abstraction in Julia for expressing parallel programs that are parallel-prefix like in structure and computation. Star hides the complexities of Julia's parallel programming model, and presents an easy-to-use abstraction to express user's parallel programs. This is joint work with Andreas Noack and Alan Edelman.
